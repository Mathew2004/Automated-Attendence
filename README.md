This program can identify individuals in front of a camera by detecting their faces and comparing them to pictures of employees or students. If a match is found, the program records their name in a Google Sheets document. However, if there is no match, it sends an alert message via a Telegram bot.

Uses Of this Project:
Somethimes we needed to count the attendance of students in educational institutions, if this program is at the entrance of the class room, then the attendance can be counted automatically by detecting the face of the students. In this case, time and labor will be less.
Suppose an office has 100 employees. The boss there wants to make sure everyone is coming to the office properly and no strangers are entering his office, then this project is for that office. As soon as the presence of 100 people is counted, if any stranger enters the office, the message will go to the boss.

If we install a camera at the entrance of our office or home, we can collect data on individuals who visit. In the event that an unknown person enters our premises, it will take a picture of this person and send me a message.
